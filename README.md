# British Airways Data Science Job Simulation

This repository contains my work for the **British Airways Data Science Virtual Experience Program** on [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/simulations/british-airways/data-science-yqoz).

## 📌 Project Overview
In this simulation, I explored how **data science plays a critical role in British Airways' success** by analyzing customer reviews and building a predictive model to better understand customer behavior. The project combined data scraping, natural language insights, and predictive modeling.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- BeautifulSoup (for web scraping)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

## 🔍 Tasks Completed
1. **Customer Review Scraping** – Collected customer review data from online sources.  
2. **Data Cleaning & Analysis** – Processed raw data and performed exploratory analysis to extract key insights.  
3. **Visualization** – Visualized review trends and customer satisfaction indicators.  
4. **Predictive Modeling** – Built a machine learning model to understand factors influencing **buying behavior**.  

## 📊 Key Insights
- Customer sentiment strongly correlated with service quality and punctuality.  
- Price sensitivity and customer satisfaction were significant drivers of purchase decisions.  
- The predictive model provided valuable insights into which features impact buying behavior the most.  

## 📁 Repository Structure
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter Notebook with scraping, analysis, and modeling.  
- `data/` – (Optional) sample dataset if allowed.  
- `images/` – Visualizations for README.  

## 📌 Outcome
This project highlighted how **data-driven insights** can help British Airways improve customer experience and optimize services. By combining web scraping, EDA, and predictive modeling, the analysis demonstrated how airlines can leverage data science for competitive advantage.
